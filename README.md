## Features  


This readme.md generator produces a perfect, professional README.md file for your next project. The program will ask you basic information about your project, including title, description, challenges, features, etc. It will also allow you to choose your preferred license badge. The resulting file will be clean, professional and ready for publication. In order to use this tool, use the following command from the project folder:
  node index.js  
Then you simply follow the prompts until you are done and the program lets you know that your readme is ready.

### Challenges encountered  
This project was a good excercise in modularization of code, and using logic to determine text output. One challenge in particular was learning how to inject string directly into my markdown template using javascript. Also, I learned a lot about markdown language and having dynamic content format correctly in the .md file.
